## Description
This is the second challenge in my bootcamp on front-end web development. This Website will update over time and will provide more information on all the projects that I have created. 

The accepance criteria was as follows:

-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
